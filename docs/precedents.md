## Technologies

[Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) is a framework for developing blockchain solutions where there are multiple parties interacting with different requirements for access to private data. 

[Hyperledger Grid](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/01/22/announcing-hyperledger-grid-a-new-project-to-help-build-and-deliver-supply-chain-solutions) framework for developing supply chain solutions. In incubation phase.
